# Deep Learning Papers Reading Roadmap

>If you are a newcomer to the Deep Learning area, the first question you may have is "Which paper should I start reading from?"

>Here is a reading roadmap of Deep Learning papers!

The roadmap is constructed in accordance with the following three guidelines:

- From outline to detail
- From old to state-of-the-art
- from generic to specific areas

I would continue adding papers to this roadmap.
